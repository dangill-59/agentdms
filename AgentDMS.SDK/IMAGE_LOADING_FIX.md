# Image Loading Fix for Electron SDK

## Problem
Previously, the Electron SDK was unable to view images due to security restrictions in the renderer process. The code was attempting to use `fetch('file://${filePath}')` which is blocked by Electron's security model.

Additionally, some users reported that images still weren't displaying correctly even after the initial fix, which led to the discovery of additional issues with drag-and-drop overlay handling and insufficient error reporting.

## Solution
Added a new IPC handler `file:readContent` in the main process that:

1. Reads file contents securely from the main process
2. Detects MIME type based on file extension
3. Converts file content to base64 data URL
4. Returns the data URL to the renderer process

The renderer process then uses this data URL to create a File object for the viewer.

**Additional Improvements (Latest Update):**
- Fixed drag overlay preservation issue in viewer component
- Enhanced error reporting and debugging capabilities
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the image loading flow

## Changes Made

### Main Process (`src/index.js`)
- Added `fs` import
- Added `file:readContent` IPC handler with security checks and MIME type detection

### Preload Script (`src/renderer/preload.js`) 
- Exposed `readFileContent` method to renderer process

### App Logic (`src/renderer/app.js`)
- Modified `openFile()` method to use the new IPC handler instead of fetch
- **NEW:** Added comprehensive debugging logs for troubleshooting
- **NEW:** Enhanced error reporting with detailed context

### Scanner Component (`src/components/scanner.js`)
- Updated `loadScannedImage()` method to use the same approach

### Viewer Component (`src/components/viewer.js`) 
- **NEW:** Fixed drag overlay preservation when loading images
- **NEW:** Enhanced error messages with file names and detailed error context
- **NEW:** Added success/failure logging for image loading operations

## Benefits
- Images can now be viewed properly in the Electron SDK
- Maintains security by reading files through the main process
- Works with all supported image formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WEBP)
- Proper error handling and MIME type detection
- **NEW:** Drag-and-drop functionality is preserved after loading images
- **NEW:** Comprehensive debugging information for troubleshooting issues
- **NEW:** Better error reporting helps identify specific problems

## Testing
- All existing tests continue to pass (27 tests)
- Added comprehensive integration tests for complete user workflow
- Added specific tests for the new improvements and edge cases
- Tests cover MIME type detection, file creation flow, and error scenarios
